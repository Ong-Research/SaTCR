# SATCR pipeline

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) pipeline for assembling TCR data, and perform a saturation analysis.

# Pipeline

![](repertoire.png)

## Instructions

To download from the command line using the command:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ong-Research/SATCR.git
```

The SATCR pipeline requires:

1. Docker: <https://www.docker.com/>
2. Snakemake: <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>

It uses Snakemake to schedule the jobs to run the pipeline, and every job is run in a different container. 

### Getting Docker images

To pull Docker images that are going to be utilized by the pipeline, using the following commands:

```sh
cd SATCR

docker pull staphb/fastqc # FastQC image
docker pull  staphb/multiqc # MultiQC image
docker pull staphb/trimmomatic # Trimmomatic image
docker build -t tcr/satcr - < Dockerfile # R and Quarto image
docker pull ghcr.io/milaboratory/mixcr/mixcr:latest # MIXCR image
```

For MIXCR to work, it is necessary to get a license from <https://mixcr.com/mixcr/getting-started/milm/> and save it into a file.

### Configuring the SATCR pipeline

###

	Create a comma-separated value (csv) with 2 columns:
	`sample_name` : The name of the sample
	`sample_file`: The prefix of the files until before the `_R1` and `_R2` parts, e.g. if the pair of RNA-seq files are data/sample1_R1_L001.fastq.gz and data/sample1_R2_L001.fastq.gz, then this column is `data/sample1`.
	Edit the `config/config.yaml` file. This file is divided by pieces in order to easily configure running the pipeline.
	General configuration parameters:
	`threads`: Max. # of parallel threads used per process.
	`samplefile`: Location of the file with the samples 
	`seed`: Seed number for random number generation and sequence sampling during saturation analysis.
	`run_*`: Logical indicators to determine if running a stage of the pipeline
	`suffix`: This is regarding to the `samplefile`. If the pair of RNA-seq files are `data/sample1_R1_L001.fastq.gz` and `data/sample1_R2_L001.fastq.gz`. The suffix would be the remaining part after the R1/R2 parts, i.e. `_L001.fastq.gz`.
	Docker configuration parameters:
	`run_line`: This is the docker command used to run every rule.
	`fastqc`, `multiqc`, `trimmomatic`, `rquarto` and `mixcr` are the names of the images that were pulled before.
In general, it is not necessary to modify these parameters unless a different image name is used or a specific need to configure how docker runs in the user’s system.
	Trimmomatic configuration parameters:
	`trimmer`: A vector with the `trimmomatic` configuration to use. More information is available in http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic. But the general idea is to remove the low-quality nucleotides at the end of the sequences, or very short sequences.
	MIXCR configuration parameters:
	`params`: The configuration line used to control MIXCR behavior. We used the line below to assemble the clonotypes analyzed used in this manuscript:
`rna-seq –species dog -b imgt.202214-2 –rna`
MIXCR provides a comprehensive list of preset configuration in https://mixcr.com/mixcr/reference/overview-built-in-presets/.
	`license_file`: Location of the file with the license. The pipeline uses this file to run MIXCR in a docker container.
	Saturation configuration parameters:
	`samples`: A vector with the sample keys for which the saturation analysis is going to be processed
	`block_size` or `nblocks`: Either the # of sequences that are going to be sampled by block or the # of blocks of sequences used to split the original sequence files. 
	`bootstrap_replicates`: The number of times that the block bootstrap sampling procedure is going to be repeated.
This rule is computationally intensive, because in total there are going to be sampled 〖(n〗_blocks-1)×n_(bootstrap replicates) pairs of sequence files and then MIXCR is used for each pair of files.
	Running the pipeline
In the instructions below, the flag `-c{k}` stands for running the rule with {k} parallel threads.
	Quality control: `snakemake -c{k} qc`. The output of this rule are an html report generated with MultiQC and quality profiles generated with the R package dada2 (Callahan et al. 2016). Either one of these analyses will depict quality score summaries at each position of the sequence files.
	Trim sequences: `snakemake -c{k} trim`. The output of this rule are the trimmed versions for every raw sequence file.
	Clonotype assembly with MIXCR: `snakemake -c{k} mixcr`. The output of this rule is a tsv file according to the AIRR format (https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/datarep/overview.html) for every set of RNA-seq paired files.
	Block bootstrap sampling: `snakemake -c{k} saturation`. This rule generates 〖(n〗_blocks-1)×n_(bootstrap replicates) pairs of compressed fastq files.
	Saturation analysis: `snakemake -c{k} saturation`
	Generate the report: `snakemake -c{k} report`. This rule produces an html report compiled by `quarto` summarizing the results of the analysis.
